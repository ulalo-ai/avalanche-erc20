üåü Introduction
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the ULALO Smart Patient Token ($ULA), a native utility token deployed on the ULALO Chain (an Avalanche L1 subnet). This token is the cornerstone of ULALO's innovative Smart Patient Wallet, designed to revolutionize healthcare data management by empowering patients with ownership and control over their medical information.
At ULALO, we believe in a future where patients are at the center of their healthcare journey. The $ULA token facilitates secure, transparent, and efficient interactions within our ecosystem, enabling seamless data exchange, consent management, and potentially incentivized participation in health initiatives.

‚ú® Features
The $ULA token, as part of the ULALO Smart Patient Wallet, supports a range of functionalities crucial for a patient-centric healthcare ecosystem:
ERC-20 Standard Compliance: Fully adheres to the ERC-20 token standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide array of wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications on the Avalanche C-Chain.
Secure Patient Data Access: While the token itself doesn't store data, it acts as a gateway and utility for accessing and managing encrypted patient data stored securely via the ULALO platform, leveraging the immutability of blockchain for consent records.
Consent Management Integration: Designed to integrate with smart contracts that manage patient consent for data sharing, ensuring that medical information is only accessed with explicit, verifiable permission.
Interoperable Healthcare Transactions: Facilitates secure and efficient transactions within the ULALO ecosystem, potentially enabling payments for services, data access, or other healthcare-related interactions.
Reward Mechanisms (Future): Future integrations may allow for incentivizing patients for sharing anonymized data for research, participating in wellness programs, or contributing to the healthcare community.
Governance (Future): Potential for token holders to participate in the governance of certain aspects of the ULALO ecosystem, fostering a truly decentralized and community-driven approach.

üöÄ Getting Started (For Developers)
To set up the development environment and interact with the $ULA token smart contract:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.x or higher)
npm or yarn
Git

A compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Core Wallet) configured for Avalanche C-Chain (Mainnet or Fuji Testnet).

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ulalo-ai/avalanche-erc20.git
cd avalanche-erc20

Install dependencies

üîó Contract Details
The $ULA token is an ERC-20 standard token deployed on the Avalanche C-Chain.
Network: Avalanche C-Chain L1 Subnet (Mainnet)
Token Name: ULALO Token
Token Symbol: $ULA
Decimals: 18

üí° Usage & Integration
Developers looking to integrate with the $ULA token can:
Interact directly with the smart contract using its ABI and address via web3 libraries (e.g., ethers.js, web3.js).
Utilize standard ERC-20 functions like transfer(), balanceOf(), and approve().
Build dApps that leverage the token for patient consent, data access, or other healthcare-related functionalities within the ULALO ecosystem.

üîí Security
Security is paramount for the ULALO Smart Patient Token. The smart contract has been developed following best practices for Solidity and ERC-20 standards.
Audits: We conducted comprehensive security audits by reputable third-party firm HLock. Audit reports is accessible here https://hashlock.com/audits/ulalo.
Immutability: Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable. Any future upgrades or changes would involve deploying a new contract and migrating tokens (if applicable).
